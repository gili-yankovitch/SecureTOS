Artemis Tools
===============================

Uploading code to an Artemis-based variant is performed by the bin_to_board.py script. This script combines the three-step process provided by Ambiq Micro into a single step that can be called from the Arduino IDE. The script is compiled to an executable for Windows, Mac, and Linux by using pyinstaller on the appropriate system. 

Artemis Secure Bootloader (SBL)
===============================

Artemis bootloader resources are kept up-to-date in the [SparkFun Artemis](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Artemis) repository on GitHub. Please see the documentation there for information about configuring and using the Secure Bootloader (SBL) from Ambiq Micro.
